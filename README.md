# dice-challenge
The dice challenge project is a simple web game that allows two players to roll two dice and see who gets the higher number. The project is made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The project consists of two main parts:

The front-end, which is the part of the project that the user sees and interacts with. This includes the HTML and CSS code that renders the game on the screen, as well as the JavaScript code that controls the game's functionality.
The back-end, which is the part of the project that is responsible for generating the random numbers and determining the winner. This is typically written in a programming language such as JavaScript.
To play the game, the user simply clicks on the "Roll Dice" button. This will generate two random numbers between 1 and 6, and display them on the screen. The player with the higher number wins.
